# Sustech_CS217_Lab
The reason why I establish this Github is just to record my study process of the course CS217-Data Structure and Algorithm Analysis.

# Introduciton
From my point of view.

During the teaching process of sorting algorithms, the professor taught us a lot about how to analyse instead of giving our students loads of coding work.

I hope sharing this documents could help you have a higher grades/gain a deeper understanding of data structure and algorithm analysis.
